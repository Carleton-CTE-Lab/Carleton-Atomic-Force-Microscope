Conversion of AFM Data read:

Following the python code for the Atomic Force Microscope indenting a surface, the data for the displacement, and strain values for the X-dir, Y-dir, and signal summation can be saved into a text file using the python application. This data can then be imported into varying Matlab files to initially set a base calibration factor through indentation on glass, and comparing that to the materials being tested.


To impliment this, the initial file of AFMGlassFitting is ran to initialize the calibration factor of the AFM system through the following process.
  
  - Import the text file data and - while the data should be automatically selected, ensure to strictly select the 4 columns of data (strain, X-diff, Y-diff, sum)

  - Change the Glass initialization variables with respect to the filename (GlassStrain = flip('Filename'.VarName1))

  - Run the code resulting in a force-curve and from here, select a starting point pretaining to the indentation, and an end point prior to the end of this travel for the code to calculate a slope value for the point of contact

  - This coefficient is then stored and can be used by the AFMCurveFittingSelection.mlx when ran on the same MatLab live editor


Similarly to the AFMGlassFitting.mlx, the steps for processing the data are as follows:
  
  - Import the data similarly to above however, importing instead the seperate Indentation and Retraction files

  - Change the filenames of the variables pretaining to the indentation and retraction of the sample

  - Run the program and select the initial starting and ending location of the section to be 'curve fit'

  - This area will then be re-fit starting at a zero-base stain value yielding another curve which can be fit further including the calibration value of the glass sample to obtain the Force vs. Indentation data of the sample
