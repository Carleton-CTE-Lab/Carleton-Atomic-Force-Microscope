This 3-D Designs folder containes .stl files and .step file for everything incorperated per system alongside both systems constructed and the combination of both systems. Within this main branch, the below sub-branches can be observed:


  Active components contains the
        - System as a whole (complete system build)
        - Cantilever holder to be 3-D printed or machined (Cantilever Redesigned with 12deg Angle)
        - Standalone AFM system as (AFM Step/Stl)
        - Standalone Flexi-scope configuration used (A Complete Flexiscope Build (AFM))
        - 3-D printed or machined holder adapter for the flexiscope to attatch to the z-axis stage (Flex-Holder - file folder)
        - PDF drawing files for the Flexi-scope and AFM config used with their parts lists in an exploded drawing (A Complete Flexiscope Build Expanded Drawing + Hanging AFM Configuration)


  Drawing Files
        - Contains older iterations of the system combination and each individual components as .PDF drawing files


  Early Iterations
        - Contains previous iterations of the system through its initialization and upgrades


  QOL Accessories contains the 3-D files(s) for the
        - Light fixture used in images of the system to provide further light beyond the room light for better image clarity (AFM Light Fixture)
        - Breadboard organization through wire clips and a container for storage (Design - Breadboard Object Container + Design - Breadboard Wire Clamp)
        - Holder that assists in attatching/glueing the cantilever to its holder


Thorlabs Components
        - .stl and .step files for each individual component associated to both systems whether it be from thorlabs specifically or other components including the microscope stage, z-axis stage, an adafruit neopixel ring (used for AFM Light Fixture), etc...


*** Within the above folders, if you .zip files strictly contain .step or .stl files of which were too large ( > 25MB ) so they were compressed to be able to upload onto GitHub***
